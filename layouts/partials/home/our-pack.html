    <p>Pack 959 offers a year-round adventure-based program designed to build character, develop citizenship, and encourage mental and physical fitness for children in grades K-5.  In addition to camping, Cubs and their families enjoy activities such as rock-climbing, snow tubing, pinewood derby, visits to military bases, and more while accommodating the needs of today’s busy families.  We are also proud of our community service projects including Red Clay Creek Clean Up, placing flags at Veterans’ graves on Memorial Day, and tree planting.</p>
    <p>Pack Meetings are held monthly from September through May at 7pm on the 3rd Friday at Grace Lutheran Church on 2033 Graves Road in Hockessin, Delaware.</p>

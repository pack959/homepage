title: Pack 959 Dues
---

Our Pack dues are $100 per year, paid in September. The cost breakdown for dues is as follows:

* $33 BSA yearly membership fee
* $12 Boys' Life subscription
* $25 Den stipend for den activities and materials
* $30 Scout advancements and awards (neckerchiefs, slides, belt loops, patches, etc)

While dues are important in funding the Pack, please remember they are only part of the equation. The other big part is our annual popcorn fundraiser.  This the only fundraising we do during the year!

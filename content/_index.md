        header: Build Character
        paragraph: >-
          Cub Scouts build character through a collection of core values by an individual that leads to moral 
          commitment and action.  A Scout is Trustworthy, Loyal, Helpful, Friendly, Courteous, Kind, Obedient, 
          Cheerful, Thrifty, Brave, Clean and Reverent.

        header: Learn Citizenship
        paragraph: >-
          Cub Scouts learn citizenship means contributing service and showing responsibility to local, state, 
          and national communities.  By helping fellow citizens in our local community, we remember the Law 
          of the Pack and what it means when we say "gives goodwill."

        paragraph: >-
          Cub Scouts learn to become personally committed to keeping their minds and bodies clean and fit.  
          A Scout knows they need to be strong and healthy in mind and body to be able to contribute to our 
          family, community, and nation.

        text: >-
          Camping at the Cub Scout level introduces young people to the outdoors and helps them develop outdoor skills 
          at an age-appropriate level that will be applied more thoroughly as a  Scout. As Cub Scouts progress, the 
          opportunities for outdoor adventures become more challenging.
      - title: Community Service
        img_path: images/flag_planting.jpg
        text: >-
          Doing service projects together is one way that Cub Scouts keep their promise "to help other people." 
          While a Scout should do their best to help other people every day, a group service project is a bigger way 
          to help people. While you’re giving service, you’re learning to work together with others to do 
          something that’s good for your community.
      - title: Pinewood Derby
        img_path: images/pwd.jpg
        text: >-
          Partnered with a parent or guardian, Cub Scouts work together, strengthening bonds and building confidence – 
          and their own custom race cars! They begin with an official Pinewood Derby Race Car kit, then create a design, 
          then carve it from the wood block provided in the kit, and detail it with paint, decals and other accessories, 
          and perfect strategies to compete in their pack’s own Pinewood Derby. It’s s a wonderful learning experience 
          centered on teamwork, ingenuity and sportsmanship – all for the thrill of the race and a lifetime of great 
          memories to share with fellow racers young and old.
      - title: Outdoor Sports

        text: >-
          Shooting sports have the ability to attract and retain youth in the movement. Millions of young people participate 
          in one or more of the sports annually—archery, rifle shooting, shotgun activities, etc.—guided by adult volunteers 
          who have the skills and knowledge to provide quality programs in a safe and effective way.

        img_path: images/tubing.jpg
        text: >-
          About once a month, our Pack gets together for an optional extra event. These events rotate but in the past we have
          slept on the Battleship New Jersey, a private screening on opening weekend of Star Wars, visited Cherry Crest Farms
          for the Pumpkin Smashing Event, Snow Tubing in the Poconos, and many, many other things.
